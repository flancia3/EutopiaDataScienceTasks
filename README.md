# EutopiaDataScienceTasks
Here are all the files required for the Eutopia data science tasks

language_words.pkl and language_words2.pkl contain dataframes where each row signifies
a world language. 
Its contents are lists of words in english and that language which are helpful when
parsing the site for specific key information such as a page link, email address,
or English description

The files were generated by the code itself, but the translator I used is very slow
and error prone, so I needed to save the languages created for a smoother experience.
There is a commented block that explains how you can alter to code to no longer use
these files, if you want.
